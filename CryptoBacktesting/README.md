# Crypto Backtesting Using Fibonacci Lines

This project is designed to backtest trading strategies for cryptocurrencies using historical 1-minute intraday data and Fibonacci retracement levels as a key indicator for making trading decisions.

## Overview

`scan_data.py` is the main script of this backtesting framework. It processes CSV files containing minute-by-minute trading data and applies a strategy based on Fibonacci retracement levels to determine entry and exit points for trades. The script simulates the performance of the strategy over the historical data, providing insights into its potential effectiveness.
